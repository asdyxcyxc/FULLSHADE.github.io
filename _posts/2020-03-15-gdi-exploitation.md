title: Abusing GDI objects for Windows 10 Kernel exploitation
---

**Introduction**

How can we make Windows exploitation way more complicated than it already is and should be? GDI Objects are a technique that is utilized via advanced Widows exploitation techniques. It's a technique seen in Windows Kernel exploitation in the sense that GDI Objects can be leveraged by an attacker to obtain code execution, and specifically in the context of Windows Kernel EOP.
