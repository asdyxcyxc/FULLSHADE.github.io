title: CVE-2020-9453 & CVE-2020-9014 - multiple Kernel corruption bugs
---


Multiple vulnerabilites have been discovered within the `Epson iProjection v2.30` software provided by EPSON. These vulnerabilities also have the potential to be weaponized and turned into privileg eescalation exploits (EOP) which may allow an attacker(s) to obtain higher-level privileges on anunpatched system. The current stage of the produced proof-of-concept exploits is a POC thatsimply sends data to the various IOCTLs which invokes a BSOD crash on the system.

This piece of software includes multiple drivers that are prone to various sets of vulnerabilities

## CVE-2020-9014

```
# Exploit Title: Epson iProjection v2.30 Driver EMP_MAU.sys Memory Corruption
# Date: 02/15/2020
# Exploit Author: FULLSHADE
# Vendor Homepage: https://epson.com
# Software Link: https://www.epson.eu/epson-projector-software
# Version: v.2.30
# Tested on: Windows 7 /  Windows 10
# CVE : CVE-2020-9453
```

* **Description:** <br>
EMP_MAU.sys is a  Windows x86 Kernel Driver that allows unprivileged user's unrestricted access while sending IOCTL's to the associated device driver. While utilizing `DeviceIoControl()`, if the user provides a NULL entry for the `dwIoControlCode` parameter. It will result in a BSOD ak.k.a Kernel-Panic. Via reverse-engineering the two drivers in IDA Pro, three IOCTLs were discovered in eachdriver in the `Dispatch Function`. All three IOCTLs are repeated in both EMP_MAU.sys and thesecond driver EMP_NSAU.sys, the three IOCTLs in question are, 0x9C402402, 0x9C402406,and 0x9C40240A.
<br>

The discovered IOCTL in question that trigger BSODs are as follow.


```
Address    | IOCTL Code | Device    | Function  | Method  |                    Access
0x1303B    | 0x9C402402 | <UNKNOWN>   0x9C40    | 0x900   | METHOD_OUT_DIRECT 2    | FILE_ANY_ACCESS (0)
0x13047    | 0x9C402406 | <UNKNOWN>   0x9C40    | 0x901   | METHOD_OUT_DIRECT 2    | FILE_ANY_ACCESS (0)
0x1304F    | 0x9C40240A | <UNKNOWN>   0x9C40    | 0x902   | METHOD_OUT_DIRECT 2    | FILE_ANY_ACCESS (0)
```
