title: Winning my first CTF, 1st place in CMD+CTRL CTF
---

Over New Years' weekend, I was fortunate enough to compete in the seasonal CMD+Ctrl CTF, the last time I competed in one of their CTF's was in person when I attended Defcon 27.

This CTF was focused on Web application penetration testing/hacking, despite my specialty being Windows exploit development and vulnerability research I was still able to come in first place. The majority of CTFs I compete in include a LOT of web app testing, so it's something I've picked up over the last few years of CTF competing, obtaining `Hall Of Fames` and awards from bug bounties, and since web app testing is such a large aspect of pen-testing.

Within this CMD+CTRL web app CTF, instead of obtaining flags and submitting them for points like you normally would during a CTF, this CTF focused on web app testing and specifically finding vulnerabilities in the web app they gave you. For example: If you trigger a SQLi vuln, you get 150 points and move up on the leaderboard, instead of a flag.

For the CTF I started 2 days late, but within the first 3 hours I was able to obtain over 30/50 challenges and place in the top 50s, but right before the CTF ended I was able to keep my 1st place (as I was also tied with a small handful of other people in first place since we finished the entire CTF, with all 50/50 or so challenges.)

After the CTF ended, I received an award for obtaining all of the challenges and scoring in first place.

Placing 1/234 is not the worst achievement one can obtain from a weekend of competing.
