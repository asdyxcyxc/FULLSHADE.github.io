title: Writing a Windows Kernel-Mode Driver - Part 1
---

This post aims to act as a resource and guide for those who wish to obtain their OSEE certification. Fair warning, I, the author have not yet obtained my OSEE certification, the following resources are what I am *using* to study for OSEE. Like always, reading various OSEE review posts is probably your best bet if you want to get a better understanding of OSEE, but these are the tools and resources I have used and been using for over the last few months in my kernel exploitation and research time.

**Set up a kernel debugging envrioment with Virtualbox**

- Check out on of my previous blog posts for setting up your kernel debugging envrioment [here]()

**IOCTL Discovery**

- First research Windows internals I/O, on of my blog posts [here]()
- IOCTL decoder tool [OSR Online](https://www.osronline.com/article.cfm%5Earticle=229.htm)
- IDA Pro plugin for IOCTL discovery [win_driver_plugin](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/win_driver_plugin)
