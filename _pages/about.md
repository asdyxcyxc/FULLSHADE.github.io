My current specialty/hobby is Offensive Windows security research, Windows kernel exploitation, pentesting, and foreign intelligence APT threat analysis.

I enjoy discovering and disclosing new 0day's through companies via responsible disclosure and building my vast CVE collection (*currently 25+*) via independent security research. I am also an avid CTF competitor, I attempt to compete weekly in a CTF competition to keep my skills and mind sharp. 

Outside of the realm of security, I enjoy a good game of chess.

Cheers!
