Welcome! I am Fu11shade, I specialize in 0day research and offensive Windows exploitation, this course is to fill in the gap on the internet for Windows exploitation content. I am rapidly working to finish the last few (newly added) posts, everything should be finished by the end of this week.

This page provides a pathway for learning Windows exploit development, following the provided blog posts will allow you to learn Windows exploit development from the basics, to advanced kernel exploitation on a Windows 10 system with all the mitigations enabled.

This course can all be downloaded as a polished PDF book format [coming soon!]

### Basic exploitation (late 1990's - early 2010's era)

[https://github.com/FULLSHADE/OSCE](https://github.com/FULLSHADE/OSCE) is my repository with over 25 from scratch written exploits

Fair warning, some of the following posts are not finished yet... Most everything else is

### Hunting Windows 0days

Once you have enough Windows exploitation knowledge, you can start auditing third-party applications and drivers for 0day vulnerabilities, below are a few that have been discovered with this level of information.

Discovered 0days by me can be found littered around my Github profile, more organization will come soon
