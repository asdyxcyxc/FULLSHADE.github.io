This page provides a pathway for learning Windows exploit development, following the provided blog posts will allow you to learn Windows exploit development from the basics, to advanced kernel exploitation on a Windows 10 system with all the mitigations enabled.

This course can all be downloaded as a polished PDF book format [coming soon!] - (maybe even Udemy!)

### Windows exploits

Once you have enough Windows exploitation knowledge, you can start auditing third-party applications and drivers for 0day vulnerabilities, below are a few that have been discovered with this level of information.
