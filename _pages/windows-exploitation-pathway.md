This page provides a pathway for learning Windows exploit development, following the provided blog posts will allow you to learn Windows exploitdevelop from the basics, to advanced kernel exploitation on a Windows 10 system.

This course can all be downloaded as a polished PDF book format [coming soon!] - (maybe even Udemy!)

#### Basic exploitation (late 1990's - early 2010's era)

The majority of the following Windows exploit development tutorials are local and remote SEH overflows, this is useful for aiding you with the `OSCE certification`. 

[https://github.com/FULLSHADE/OSCE](https://github.com/FULLSHADE/OSCE) is my repository with over 25 from scratch written exploits

Learning in-depth Windows Internals theory is extremely crucial for getting into any sort of Windows exploit development past the basics (JMP ESP, SEH, egghunters, etc.) I can't recommend `Windows Internals` from Pavel Yosifovich more.

#### Windows kernel exploitation (2010 - 2013 era)

Getting into Windows kernel exploitation first needs to be done by learning the variety of vulnerability classes that you are likely to encounter, learning the basic types of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques can be done with the HEVD vulnerable driver.

#### Advanced Windows kernel exploitation (2016 - 2020 era)

Once you understand the various vulnerability classes you can start porting exploits to higher versions on Windows, and you can also start bypassing advanced mitigations, and utilizing advanced methods for information leaks, and such.

#### Windows exploits

Once you have enough Windows exploitation knowledge, you can start auditing third-party applications and drivers for 0day vulnerabilities, below are a few that have been discovered with this level of information.
