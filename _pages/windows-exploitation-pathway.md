This page provides a pathway for learning Windows exploit development, following the provided blog posts will allow you to learn Windows exploit development from the basics, to advanced kernel exploitation on a Windows 10 system with all the mitigations enabled.

This course can all be downloaded as a polished PDF book format [coming soon!]

### Windows exploits

Once you have enough Windows exploitation knowledge, you can start auditing third-party applications and drivers for 0day vulnerabilities, below are a few that have been discovered with this level of information.

### Using winAPI in C++ for offensive purposes

[I have a LOT of posts to add here]

### Writing win32 shellcode

[doesn't exist yet]
